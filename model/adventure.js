A streak of bright golden light shoot across the sky, explodes into three closely flashing beams that touched the distant ground all at once with a shattering boom. Delighted at the prospect of finding the remnants of this meteor impact, you follow its direction. You reach the edge of the river islet. What do you do?`,
